# Project-Specific Documentation

## Purpose
This folder contains all documentation specific to the PNut-Term-TS project - a cross-platform debug terminal for the Parallax Propeller2 microcontroller.

## Intent
- **Project Architecture**: How THIS system is designed and built
- **Implementation Details**: Specific to this codebase
- **Build & Test Procedures**: How to work with this project
- **User Documentation**: For end users of PNut-Term-TS

## What Belongs Here
- System architecture and design documents
- Build system configuration and procedures
- Test procedures and coverage requirements
- Implementation status tracking
- User guides and tutorials
- Pascal source references (for parity)
- Command references for this application
- Technical debt tracking

## What Does NOT Belong Here
- Generic development methodologies
- Portable process documentation
- Claude-specific guidance
- Sprint artifacts (those go in project-sprints)

## Key Documents
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design and component structure
- **IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md**: Progress on debug window implementations
- **COMMANDS.md**: Build and test command reference
- **USER-GUIDE.md**: End-user documentation
- **PASCAL-REFERENCES.md**: Original Pascal source locations

## Usage
These documents are essential for understanding, building, and maintaining the PNut-Term-TS project. They are not portable to other projects but crucial for this one.
