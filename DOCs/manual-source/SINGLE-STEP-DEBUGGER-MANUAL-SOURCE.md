## Overview

The Parallax Propeller 2 Single-Step Debugger provides interactive debugging of PASM2 code running on the P2 microcontroller. It is a **bidirectional** system: the P2 captures cog state and transmits it to the host PC, while the host renders the display and sends commands back to the P2.

### Key Features

- Single-step and continuous execution control
- Real-time inspection of all 512 COG registers, 512 LUT registers, and 507,904 bytes of HUB RAM
- 8-level hardware stack display
- Heatmap visualization showing register and memory changes
- Disassembly with three viewing modes (follow PC, cog lock, hub lock)
- Automatic register change tracking (delta watch list)
- Smart pin monitoring (64 pins via RQPIN)
- Interrupt and event status
- Per-cog debugger windows (each cog gets its own window)
- Inter-cog debugging via COGBRK

### Important Notes

- The debugger is **read-only** — you cannot modify register or memory values from the debugger UI
- The top 16KB of HUB RAM (`$FC000`-`$FFFFF`) is reserved for the debugger infrastructure and is not visible in the HUB viewer
- The debuggable HUB range is `$00000`-`$7BFFF` (507,904 bytes)

## Invoking the Debugger

### DEBUG Statement in Code

The debugger opens automatically when the P2 executes a `DEBUG` statement:

```spin2
PUB main()
  DEBUG                          ' Triggers debugger breakpoint
```

### Break on COGINIT

Define `DEBUG_COGINIT` to break whenever a cog starts:

```spin2
CON
  DEBUG_COGINIT = 1              ' Break on every COGINIT
```

This sets the initial BRK condition to `$110` (INIT + DEBUG bits).

### Break on First Execution

Define `DEBUG_MAIN` to break on the first instruction executed:

```spin2
CON
  DEBUG_MAIN = 1                 ' Break at initial cog execution
```

This sets the initial BRK condition to `$001` (MAIN bit).

---

## Debugger Window Layout

Each cog gets its own debugger window titled "Debugger - Cog N". The window uses a **123-column x 77-half-row** character grid:

```
     Col 2      Col 13    Col 24                          Col 82  Col 96  Col 116

> wheel, or a pointer/SFR click to navigate. Tracked in `TECHNICAL-DEBT.md`.

### Mouse Wheel

**In disassembly box** (switches to cog/hub lock mode if in follow-PC mode):

| Modifier | Cog Scroll | Hub Scroll |
|----------|------------|------------|
| None | 1 register | 16 bytes |
| Ctrl | 4 registers | 1 byte |
| Shift | 16 registers | 4 bytes |
| Ctrl+Shift | 32 registers | 128 bytes |

**In hub address digits**: Each scroll step changes the hex nibble under the cursor by +/-1.

**In hub data box**: Same modifier scheme with hub-specific scroll amounts.

### Mouse Hover (Hint Bar)

Moving the mouse over any region displays context-sensitive information in the hint bar at the bottom of the window:
- Registers: address, name, and current value
- Events: event description
- Buttons: break condition description
- CT: elapsed seconds at current clock frequency
- XBYTE: detailed mode description
- Hub data: address and byte value

---

## Breakpoint Control Buttons

The button panel occupies the bottom-right of the window.

### Break Condition Buttons

Break conditions are **bitmask flags** that can be combined (not mutually exclusive enums):

| Button | Bit | Mask | Description |
|--------|-----|------|-------------|
| **MAIN** | 0 | `$001` | Single-step main code instructions |
| **INT1** | 1 | `$002` | Single-step INT1 instructions |
| **INT2** | 2 | `$004` | Single-step INT2 instructions |
| **INT3** | 3 | `$008` | Single-step INT3 instructions |
| **DEBUG** | 4 | `$010` | Break on DEBUG (BRK with non-zero code) |
| **INT1E** | 5 | `$020` | Break on INT1 entry |
| **INT2E** | 6 | `$040` | Break on INT2 entry |
| **INT3E** | 7 | `$080` | Break on INT3 entry |
| **INIT** | 8 | `$100` | Break on COGINIT (independent — never cleared by other buttons) |
| **EVENT** | 9 | `$200` | Break on event (event ID in bits 15..12) |
| **ADDR** | 10 | `$400` | Break on address match (address in bits 31..12) |
| **BREAK** | — | — | Clear all conditions except INIT (async break mode) |

**Bit 11** (`$800`) is the **STALL** flag — used internally to keep the cog halted in the debug polling loop. Not a user-settable button.

**Left-click** sets a condition exclusively (replaces all others except INIT). **Right-click** toggles a condition without affecting others. INIT (bit 8) is always independent.

### Go/Stop/Break Button

| Caption | State | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Go** | Cog is halted | Left-click or Space: single step; Right-click or Enter: repeat mode |
| **Stop** | Repeat mode active | Any click: stop execution |
| **Break** | Cog running, 250ms timeout expired | Display dims; waiting for next break |

When the cog is running and 250ms pass without a breakpoint, the display dims (each pixel halved in brightness) and the button shows "Break".

---

## Display Regions

### Register and LUT Heatmaps (Left Side)

Two narrow bitmaps spanning nearly the full window height:

- **REG bitmap**: 32 pixels wide x 512 pixels tall — one row per cog register (`$000`-`$1FF`), one column per bit (MSB left, LSB right)
- **LUT bitmap**: Same structure for LUT addresses (`$200`-`$3FF`)

**Color encoding** (yellow-based palette, not blue/white):
- **Just changed** (hit value = 254): bright yellow (`cHighDiff`/`cLowDiff`)
- **Decaying**: fades by 2 per break toward cold
- **Unchanged** (cold): dark yellow (`cHighSame`/`cLowSame`)
- High bits (=1) use `cHigh*` colors; low bits (=0) use `cLow*` colors

Click on a heatmap cell to lock the disassembly view to that address.

### C Flag, Z Flag, and Program Counter (Top Row)

- **C flag**: Single character '0' or '1' (from bit 31 of interrupt return register)
- **Z flag**: Single character '0' or '1' (from bit 30 of interrupt return register)
- **PC**: 5 hex digits (20-bit program counter)

### SKIP/SKIPF Pattern (Top Row)

32-bit pattern showing which instructions are skipped. Label shows "SKIP" or "SKIPF" depending on mode. Shown dimmed with explanatory message when suspended during CALL or interrupt.

### XBYTE Status (Top Row)

9-bit XBYTE configuration displayed as 3 hex digits. A dim checkmark glyph is always present; it brightens to orange when C/Z are affected by XBYTE.

### Clock Ticks (Top Row)

64-bit CT value displayed as 16 hex digits in two 8-digit groups. Hint bar shows elapsed seconds computed from the clock frequency.

### Disassembly View (Middle)

16 lines of disassembled P2 instructions. Three modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Follow PC** (`dmPC`) | Auto-scrolls to keep PC visible; positions PC at line 4 (from top) |
| **Cog Lock** (`dmCog`) | Locked to a cog/LUT address; scroll with mouse wheel |
| **Hub Lock** (`dmHub`) | Locked to a hub address; scroll with mouse wheel |

Each line shows: address + raw 32-bit opcode + disassembled mnemonic and operands. The current PC line is highlighted with an inverse-color rounded rectangle. Instructions with SKIP bits set show a semi-transparent strikethrough. Address breakpoints show as semi-transparent highlights.

### Register Watch List (Middle-Right)

Automatically tracks up to 16 cog registers (`$000`-`$1EF`) that have changed. Shows 3-digit hex address + 8-digit hex value. Entries persist for ~1000 breaks after last change, then age out. Press **R** to clear.

### Special Function Registers (Middle-Right)

All 16 SFRs at `$1F0`-`$1FF` displayed in two columns:

```
$1F0  IJMP3  xxxxxxxx      $1F8   PTRA  xxxxxxxx
$1F1  IRET3  xxxxxxxx      $1F9   PTRB  xxxxxxxx
$1F2  IJMP2  xxxxxxxx      $1FA   DIRA  xxxxxxxx
$1F3  IRET2  xxxxxxxx      $1FB   DIRB  xxxxxxxx
$1F4  IJMP1  xxxxxxxx      $1FC   OUTA  xxxxxxxx
$1F5  IRET1  xxxxxxxx      $1FD   OUTB  xxxxxxxx
$1F6     PA  xxxxxxxx      $1FE    INA  xxxxxxxx
$1F7     PB  xxxxxxxx      $1FF    INB  xxxxxxxx
```

Click on IJMP/IRET values to navigate disassembly to that address. Click on PA/PB/PTRA/PTRB to navigate the hub viewer.

### Event Flags (Right)

16 P2 events displayed as single '0' or '1' characters:

| Index | Event | Index | Event |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0 | INT | 8 | PAT |
| 1 | CT1 | 9 | FBW |
| 2 | CT2 | 10 | XMT |
| 3 | CT3 | 11 | XFI |
| 4 | SE1 | 12 | XRO |
| 5 | SE2 | 13 | XRL |
| 6 | SE3 | 14 | ATN |
| 7 | SE4 | 15 | QMT |

Click on an event name to set it as the event breakpoint target.

### Execution Mode (Below Disassembly)

Tab label showing current execution context: **MAIN**, **INT1**, **INT2**, or **INT3**.

### Stack Registers

8 hardware stack values displayed as 8-digit hex. STK0 is top of stack. Click on a value to navigate to it as a code/hub pointer.

### Interrupt Status

Three interrupt levels (INT1/INT2/INT3), each showing the assigned event name and state (idle, wait, or busy).

### Pointer Data (FPTR, PTRA, PTRB)

Three rows showing 14 bytes of memory centered on each pointer:

```
Rxx  xxxxx  xx xx xx xx xx xx [xx] xx xx xx xx xx xx xx  ..............
PTRA xxxxx  xx xx xx xx xx xx [xx] xx xx xx xx xx xx xx  ..............
PTRB xxxxx  xx xx xx xx xx xx [xx] xx xx xx xx xx xx xx  ..............
```

FPTR prefix shows 'R' (read) or 'W' (write). Center byte (index 6) is highlighted. Click to navigate.

### Status Indicators

Five flags highlighted in bright orange when active, dimmed when inactive:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| INIT | COGINIT occurred |
| STALLI | Stall interrupt active |
| STR | Streamer active |
| MOD | Color modulator active |
| LUTS | LUT sharing active |

### Pin Registers

Three rows of 64-bit binary values (DIR, OUT, IN) split into byte groups:

```
DIR  xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
OUT  xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
IN   xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
```

### Smart Pin Watch

Automatically tracks up to 7 smart pins with changed RQPIN values. Shows pin number (P00-P61) + 8-digit hex value. Pins 62/63 (TX/RX) are excluded. By default only pins with DIR bit set are shown; right-click to toggle showing all pins.

### Hub Data Viewer

8 rows x 16 bytes of hub memory:

```
xxxxx  xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx  xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx  ................
```

Each row: 5-digit address + 16 hex bytes + 16 ASCII characters (non-printable shown as '.'). Address wraps at `$FFFFF`.

Navigation: arrow keys (Up/Down = +/-`$10`), page keys with modifiers, mouse wheel on address digits to change individual nibbles, click on a hub data byte to jump. (Clicking the hub heatmap to jump is not yet wired — see Mouse Controls note.)

### Hub Heatmap

Small bitmap (64 x 62 pixels) showing block-level change activity across hub memory. Each pixel represents one 128-byte sub-block (3,968 sub-blocks total). Brighter = recently changed.

### Hint Bar

Context-sensitive status bar at the bottom showing details about whatever the mouse is hovering over.

## Multi-COG Debugging

Each cog that hits a breakpoint gets its **own separate debugger window**. There is no tab-switching between cogs — you work with multiple windows simultaneously.

### COGBRK (Asynchronous Break)

One cog can force another into the debugger using the `COGBRK` instruction:

```spin2
COGBRK  #3             ' Force cog 3 into debugger
```

**Important limitations**:
- The target cog must have debugging enabled
- Async break from the host only works when another cog is currently halted in its debug ISR (and thus processing the serial protocol)
- If no cog is in debug, there is no way to force a break from the host

### Viewing Another Cog's State

When a cog is halted at a breakpoint, you can request COGBRK for other cogs via the protocol. The target cog enters its debug ISR and opens its own debugger window.

---

## DEBUG Statement Formatting

The debugger supports various output formats for `DEBUG` statements in the text console:

```spin2
' Decimal formats
DEBUG(UDEC(value))             ' Unsigned decimal
DEBUG(SDEC(value))             ' Signed decimal

' Hexadecimal formats
DEBUG(UHEX(value))             ' Unsigned hex
DEBUG(SHEX(value))             ' Signed hex

' Binary formats
DEBUG(UBIN(value))             ' Unsigned binary
DEBUG(SBIN(value))             ' Signed binary

' Floating point
DEBUG(FDEC(fpvalue))           ' Float as decimal

' Strings
DEBUG(ZSTR(@string))           ' Zero-terminated string

' Boolean
DEBUG(BOOL(value))             ' Boolean value

' Arrays (append _ARRAY suffix and add count)
DEBUG(UDEC_BYTE_ARRAY(@array, count))

' Timing
DEBUG(DLY(1000))               ' Delay 1000ms after output

' PC interaction
DEBUG(PC_KEY(@buffer))         ' Get keyboard input from host
DEBUG(PC_MOUSE(@buffer))       ' Get mouse input from host

' Flags
DEBUG(C_Z)                     ' Output "C=? Z=?"
```

Each format supports display specifiers controlling separator and label output.

## Configuration Symbols

Define these `CON` symbols in your Spin2 source to configure debugging:

| Symbol | Default | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `DEBUG_DISABLE` | 0 | Non-zero disables all DEBUG statements |
| `DEBUG_PIN_TX` (or `DEBUG_PIN`) | 62 | TX pin number |
| `DEBUG_PIN_RX` | 63 | RX pin number |
| `DEBUG_BAUD` | Download baud | Serial baud rate |
| `DEBUG_COGS` | `$FF` (all) | Bitmask of cogs to enable debugging on |
| `DEBUG_COGINIT` | — | If defined, break on COGINIT events |
| `DEBUG_MAIN` | — | If defined, break on initial cog execution |
| `DEBUG_DELAY` | 0 | Startup delay in milliseconds |
| `DEBUG_TIMESTAMP` | — | If defined, show 64-bit timestamps in output |
| `DEBUG_LEFT/TOP/WIDTH/HEIGHT` | — | Host terminal window position |
| `DEBUG_DISPLAY_LEFT/TOP` | — | Host display window position |
| `DEBUG_LOG_SIZE` | 0 | Host log file size (0 = disabled) |
| `DEBUG_WINDOWS_OFF` | 0 | Suppress host debug windows |

---

## Tips and Common Scenarios

### Understanding the Display States

- **Halted**: Cog stopped at breakpoint. Display fully rendered. Go button shows "Go".
- **Single Go**: After pressing Space. Cog executes until break condition met, then halts again.
- **Repeat Mode**: After pressing Enter. Cog runs continuously with throttled updates (~20 breaks/sec). Press Enter or Space to stop.
- **Running (dimmed)**: 250ms timeout without a breakpoint. Display dims, Go button shows "Break".

### Finding Memory Corruption

1. Place `DEBUG` statements around suspicious code
2. Run until breakpoint
3. Examine the **hub heatmap** for unexpected bright spots (recently written areas)
4. Navigate the hex dump to that area (address-nibble wheel, or click a nearby hub byte) — direct hub-heatmap click is not yet wired
5. Switch disassembly to hub mode, navigate to suspect code
6. Single-step while watching the hub heatmap for the write

### Debugging Interrupts

1. Enable the appropriate **INT1/INT2/INT3** single-step button (left column)
2. Or enable **INT1E/INT2E/INT3E** entry break button to catch interrupt entry
3. Monitor the **Event Flags** panel to see which events are triggering
4. Check interrupt vectors in the **SFR** panel (IJMP1/IRET1, etc.)

### Watching Register Changes

The register watch list automatically populates when registers change between breakpoints. This is purely automatic — you don't manually add registers. The heatmap provides a visual overview, and the watch list shows specific values. Press **R** to clear the accumulated watch list.

### Navigating Disassembly

- **Follow PC mode** (default): Disassembly auto-scrolls to keep PC visible
- Use **mouse wheel** in the disassembly box to switch to cog/hub lock mode for free scrolling
- **Click on the PC box** to return to follow-PC mode
- **Click on an SFR** (IJMP/IRET) to navigate disassembly to that address
- **Right-click** in disassembly to set/clear an address breakpoint at that line

### Performance Overhead

- The debugger stub occupies the top 16KB of hub RAM (`$FC000`-`$FFFFF`)
- Lock[15] is reserved for debugger mutual exclusion
- Serial pins (default 62/63) are used for debug communication
- Clock frequency must be at least 10 MHz

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / Solution |
|---------|-----------------|
| Debugger window not opening | Ensure debug mode is enabled; check that `DEBUG_WINDOWS_OFF` is not set |
| Cog not breaking | Verify break condition bits match your intent; check `DEBUG_COGS` bitmask includes the target cog |
| Display dimmed, showing "Break" | Cog is running and hasn't hit a break condition in 250ms; check your break condition settings |
| COGBRK not working | Another cog must be halted in its debugger for async break to work; if no cog is in debug, the host cannot force a break |
| Hub data not updating | Only changed 4KB blocks are re-transferred; if the data hasn't changed since last break, it won't refresh |
