```

### PART 3: Visual Observations
- **Cog 1 debugger window**: Opens correctly, but NO CONTENT displayed (same as before)
- **Main window menu**: Black region with ONLY green border at bottom visible
  - The green border we added for debugging is showing
  - Menu items are NOT visible
  - Suggests possible z-index/layering issue or menu content not rendering

---

## Analysis

### Issue 1: Debugger Window Still Shows No Content
**Status**: ❌ NOT FIXED

Despite adding retry mechanism, the debugger window still shows no content. The log confirms:
```
[DEBUGGER] Window components not ready for COG 1, deferring message
```

This means our deferred message handling is working (message is being stored), but the retry mechanism isn't successfully processing the message after components are ready.

### Issue 2: Menu Only Shows Green Border
**Status**: ❌ PARTIALLY FIXED

The green debug border is visible, confirming:
- The menu bar element exists in the DOM
- CSS is being applied (background color and border)
- But the menu content (File, Edit, View, etc.) is NOT visible

This suggests either:
1. The menu HTML injection is failing
2. The menu content has incorrect z-index/visibility
3. The setTimeout delay isn't working as expected

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Debugger Window Problem
Looking at the code flow:
1. Message arrives and gets deferred ✅
2. Components initialize ✅
3. `componentsReady` flag is set ✅
4. But `processDeferredMessages()` either:
   - Isn't being called
   - Is being called before renderer is ready
   - The renderer proxy issue prevents proper display

### Menu Display Problem
The green border proves the menu bar element exists, but content isn't visible:
1. "MENU LOADING..." text should appear first
2. Then actual menu after 100ms
3. Neither is visible, only the border

This indicates the innerHTML injection isn't working or is being overwritten.

---

## Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix Debugger Renderer
The core issue is that we're passing `null` for the renderer in the interaction. We need to implement an IPC-based rendering solution that works across Electron's process boundaries.

### Priority 2: Debug Menu HTML Injection
Need to verify if the innerHTML is actually being set and why it's not visible. Add more debugging to track the menu content lifecycle.

### Priority 3: Verify Component Initialization Order
Ensure all debugger components are truly ready before processing deferred messages.```
