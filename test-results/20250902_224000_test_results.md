## Test Build: v2 with Menu and Debugger Fixes

### Test Environment
- Package: electron-ready-macos (v2)
- Device: /dev/tty.usbserial-P9cektn7
- Test Command: TEST.command with P2 hardware

## Critical Issue Still Present

### ❌ Debugger Window - SAME PROBLEM
```
[DEBUGGER] Window components not ready for COG 1, deferring message
```

**This is the EXACT same error as before!**

Despite our fix moving `dataManager` and `protocol` initialization to the constructor, the message is still being deferred. This means:

1. The components are being created in the constructor
2. But `componentsReady` flag is still false when the message arrives
3. The message arrives BEFORE `did-finish-load` event fires

### Timing Analysis from Logs

1. **22:40:13.838** - Window instance registered
2. **22:40:13.838** - Window ready to show  
3. **22:40:13.838** - Window registered with router
4. **22:40:13.838** - Window marked as ready
5. **22:40:13.838** - Processing 1 queued message
6. **22:40:13.838** - **"Window components not ready"** - deferring message

The problem is clear: The message is being processed from the queue BEFORE the `did-finish-load` event has fired to set `componentsReady = true`.

## Root Cause

The window processes queued messages immediately when marked as ready by the base class, but the `did-finish-load` event (which sets `componentsReady = true`) hasn't fired yet. There's a race condition between:

1. Window being marked ready by base class
2. `did-finish-load` event firing in the window

## Other Observations

### ✅ Debug Logger 
- Working perfectly
- Showing all COG messages with timestamps

### ❓ Menu Bar Status
- Need visual confirmation from user
- No errors in console about menu

### ❓ Main Terminal
- Need visual confirmation

## Next Steps Required

We need to fix the timing issue by either:
1. Setting `componentsReady = true` earlier (in constructor or ready-to-show)
2. OR removing the `componentsReady` check entirely since we now create components in constructor
3. OR delaying message processing until after did-finish-load

## Questions for User

1. **Menu Bar**: Is it now the correct color (light gray) and are the menu items clickable?
2. **Debugger Window**: Still blank content area?
3. **Any other visual issues?**
