- Font selection
- Control line preferences

### About Dialog
Should display:
- Application version
- Electron/Node/Chrome versions

## Known Working Features from Previous Tests

✅ **From v5 testing:**
- Debugger window now shows content (p2debugger_cog1 with PC, state, instruction)
- Menu system mechanically works (clicks, dropdowns)
- IPC communication established
- Toolbar buttons (RAM/FLASH/DTR) remain functional

## Implementation Notes

### What Was Changed from v5
1. **Removed incorrect menus**: File/Connect, Device menu, View/Zoom
2. **Added proper menus**: Recording operations, Debug menu, Window management
3. **Moved Settings**: From Tools menu to File menu
4. **Removed Tools menu**: Redistributed items (Settings → File, Performance → Debug)
5. **Added keyboard shortcuts**: Displayed in menu items
6. **Implemented IPC handlers**: All menu items now have backend connections

### Placeholder Implementations
Some features have basic implementations that log to console:
- Window Cascade/Tile
- Break/Resume All COGs
- Some recording features

These will be fully implemented in future iterations.

## Testing Checklist

## Summary

**V6 is ready for comprehensive testing** with the complete professional menu system as documented in the project specifications. The menu structure now matches the intended design for a debugging environment rather than just a serial terminal.

The focus has shifted from serial port operations (which are handled by toolbar buttons) to debugging and recording capabilities, making this a proper debug terminal for the Parallax Propeller 2.
