# Test Results - 2025-09-02 22:31:00

## Test Environment
- Package: electron-ready-macos
- Device: /dev/tty.usbserial-P9cektn7
- Test Command: TEST.command with P2 hardware connected

## Key Observations

### ✅ SUCCESSES
1. **Application launches successfully** in standalone mode
2. **Debug Logger window auto-creates** and displays COG messages correctly
3. **Message routing works** - COG messages properly identified and routed
4. **416-byte debugger packets detected** from COG1
5. **Debugger window auto-creates** for COG1 when packet received
6. **Window registration works** - Both logger and debugger register with WindowRouter

### ❌ ISSUES FOUND

#### 1. Debugger Window Content Not Displaying
**Symptom**: Debugger window opens but shows no content
**Evidence from logs**:
```
[DEBUGGER] Window components not ready for COG 1, deferring message
```
This occurs AFTER the window is shown and registered, indicating our fix didn't fully resolve the timing issue.

#### 2. Menu Bar Status Unknown
The logs don't show any menu-related errors or confirmations. Need visual confirmation from user about whether menu is displaying correctly.

## Log Analysis

### Message Flow
1. COG0 messages received and displayed in Debug Logger ✅
2. COG1 messages received and displayed in Debug Logger ✅
3. 416-byte packet from COG1 triggers debugger window creation ✅
4. Debugger window created and shown ✅
5. Message deferred due to components not ready ❌

### Critical Log Sequence
```
[DEBUGGER] Successfully created debugger window for COG1
[DEBUGGER] Sending 416-byte packet to debugger window for COG1
Base: - Queued message for debugger (1 in queue)
...
?Base?: Debugger window for COG 1 ready to show
Base: - Processing 1 queued messages
[DEBUGGER] Window components not ready for COG 1, deferring message
```

The window processes queued messages but still considers components not ready, even though we set `componentsReady = true` in did-finish-load.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Questions for User:
1. **Is the menu bar visible and functional?** (File, Edit, Device, View menus)
2. **Does the debugger window show any content at all?** (blank vs partial content)
3. **Are there any visual anomalies?** (overlapping elements, missing UI components)

### Potential Fix Needed:
The debugger window's `componentsReady` flag may not be set early enough. The message is being processed from the queue but still hitting the deferral logic, suggesting the flag isn't set when we think it is.

## Status Summary
- **Menu Bar**: Status unknown - need visual confirmation
- **Debug Logger**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Debugger Window**: ❌ Opens but doesn't display content
- **Message Routing**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Window Creation**: ✅ Working correctly
