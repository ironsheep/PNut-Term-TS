# Build v2 Results - 2025-09-02 22:36:00

## Changes in This Build

### 1. Menu Bar Interactivity Fix
**Problem**: Menu items displayed but didn't respond to clicks
**Solution**: 
- Exposed `ipcRenderer` to `window` object globally
- Added error handling for when ipcRenderer isn't available
- Fixed event handler attachment in initMenu()

### 2. Menu Bar Appearance Fix
**Problem**: Menu bar was black (#2d2d30) instead of matching toolbar
**Solution**:
- Changed background color from #2d2d30 to #f5f5f5 (matching toolbar)
- Updated text colors from light (#cccccc) to dark (#333333) for readability
- Changed dropdown background to white with proper shadows
- Updated hover states to use light gray (#e0e0e0, #e8e8e8)

### 3. Debugger Window Content Display Fix
**Problem**: Window opened but showed no content due to componentsReady check failing
**Root Cause**: `dataManager` and `protocol` were created in `initializeWindow()` which runs AFTER `did-finish-load`
**Solution**:
- Moved creation of `dataManager` and `protocol` to constructor
- They're now available immediately when window is created
- This allows deferred messages to be processed on `did-finish-load`

## Expected Results

### Menu Bar
- ✅ Should now match toolbar color (light gray #f5f5f5)
- ✅ Text should be dark and readable
- ✅ Dropdown menus should be white with proper borders
- ✅ Menu items should respond to clicks and send IPC messages

- ✅ Should display COG debug data immediately
- ✅ Canvas should render debug information
- ✅ No more "components not ready" warnings
