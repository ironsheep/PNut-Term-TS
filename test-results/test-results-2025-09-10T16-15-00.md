## Logic Window Height Fix Testing

### User Feedback:
- Still only showing 5 channels on screen with gap above
- Missing 6th channel and gap below
- Still appears to be 5/7 the correct size
- Window creation size values appear to be wrong

### Next Investigation:
Need to examine the actual browser window creation size values to find where the disconnect is between calculated dimensions and actual window size.

## Console Log Output:
