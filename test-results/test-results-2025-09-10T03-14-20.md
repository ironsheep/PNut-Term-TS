## Console Log Results

### Summary: 103,038 lines of console output showing successful startup followed by recurring script execution errors

**Key Findings:**

1. **CRITICAL: Massive UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning flood**
   - Pattern: `Error: Script failed to execute, this normally means an error was thrown. Check the renderer console for the error.`
   - First occurrence: Line 570 (during Logic window creation)
   - Continues throughout session with rejection IDs incrementing (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...)
   - Indicates serious renderer-side JavaScript errors

2. **Successful Application Startup**
   - Electron app launches correctly (version 0.1.0, build 9/9/2025)
   - Connected to device: `/dev/tty.usbserial-P9cektn7`
   - WindowRouter and SerialProcessor initialize successfully
   - Debug Logger window creates and registers properly

3. **Window Creation Success**
   - All debug windows appear to create successfully:
     - Logic window (MyLogic) registers at line 566
     - Other windows follow similar pattern
   - Windows register with WindowRouter correctly

4. **Clean Session Termination**
   - All windows close properly in sequence: MyLogic → MyTerm → MyScope → MyXY
   - WindowRouter unregisters windows correctly
   - Application quits cleanly: "All windows closed, quitting app"

## Debug Logger Results

### Summary: 5,239 lines showing successful data flow but performance warnings

**Key Findings:**

1. **Data Flow Working**
   - Logic samples: `MyLogic 0` through `MyLogic 500` (continuous numbering)
   - XY data: `MyXY 0, 0, 0, 120, 0, 240` through `MyXY 500, 500, 500, 620, 500, 740`
   - Scope and Terminal data present
   - All debug windows receiving their intended data

2. **Performance Warning**
   - Line 5234: `[PERF_WARN] Processing latency 105ms exceeds threshold`
   - Suggests UI update frequency may be too high
   - Recommendation: "reduce UI update frequency, disable non-essential features"

3. **Clean Data Pattern**
   - No data corruption or missing samples
   - Proper window close sequence captured
   - Session starts and ends cleanly

## Analysis: What's Not Working

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Renderer Script Execution Failures

**Problem:** Massive flood of `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning` starting around Logic window creation

**Impact:** 
- While data flows through the backend correctly, renderer-side JavaScript is failing
- This likely means windows are receiving data but failing to display it properly
- The script execution errors suggest DOM manipulation or rendering code is throwing exceptions

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- Canvas rendering code throwing unhandled exceptions
- DOM manipulation after window destruction
- Race conditions between data updates and window lifecycle
- Missing error handling in renderer-side display code

### ⚠️ SECONDARY ISSUE: Performance Latency

**Problem:** Processing latency exceeding 105ms threshold
**Impact:** Sluggish UI updates, potential data backup
**Priority:** Medium (address after fixing script errors)

### ✅ WHAT'S WORKING WELL

1. **Backend Data Pipeline**: SerialProcessor → MessageRouter → WindowRouter → Debug Windows
2. **Window Lifecycle**: Creation, registration, and cleanup all working
3. **Data Parsing**: All message types parsed and routed correctly  
4. **Application Stability**: No crashes, clean shutdown

### 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Investigate renderer console for specific JavaScript errors
2. **HIGH**: Add try-catch blocks around canvas rendering operations
3. **HIGH**: Review window updateContent() methods for unhandled promise operations
4. **MEDIUM**: Optimize update frequency to reduce performance warnings

### Technical Context

The test shows a classic **backend working, frontend failing** scenario. The two-tier architecture is successfully:
- Processing serial data
- Routing messages to correct windows  
- Managing window lifecycle

But the renderer processes are throwing unhandled exceptions, likely in:
- Canvas drawing operations (debugLogicWin.ts, debugScopeWin.ts, etc.)
- DOM updates in updateContent() methods
- Event handler code
