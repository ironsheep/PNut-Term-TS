# Claude Reference Documentation

## Purpose
This folder contains reference materials, command guides, and operational documentation for specific tools used when working with Claude - particularly todo-mcp and TodoWrite.

## Intent
- **Tool-Specific Reference**: How to use todo-mcp v0.6.8 effectively
- **Command Syntax**: Exact formats and parameters for MCP commands
- **Success Stories**: What works well with current tool versions
- **Friction Logs**: Known issues and workarounds
- **Version-Specific**: Tied to specific tool versions (currently v0.6.8)

## What Belongs Here
- todo-mcp command reference and examples
- TodoWrite usage patterns
- MCP parameter formats and dual-resolution system
- Tool version experiences and friction points
- Success stories demonstrating productivity gains
- Workarounds for known tool limitations

## What Does NOT Belong Here
- Generic process methodology
- Project implementation details
- Pure Claude interaction patterns (those go in claude-process)

## Key Documents
- **TODO-MCP-V068-SUCCESS-STORIES.md**: What works brilliantly in v0.6.8
- **TODO-MCP-V068-EXPERIENCE.md**: Complete v0.6.8 usage guide
- **TODO-MCP-V070-FRICTION.md**: Issues to address in future versions
- **MCP_FRICTION_LOG.md**: Historical friction points and resolutions

## Usage
Reference these documents when you need specific command syntax or encounter issues with todo-mcp. These are working documents that evolve with tool updates.
