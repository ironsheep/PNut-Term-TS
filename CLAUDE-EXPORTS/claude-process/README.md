# Claude Process Documentation

## Purpose
This folder contains methodologies and patterns for working effectively with Claude as an AI development assistant. While these documents mention Claude specifically, the principles often apply to working with any AI coding assistant.

## Intent
- **Claude-Specific Guidance**: How to collaborate effectively with Claude
- **Portable with Adaptation**: Principles apply to other AI assistants
- **Session Management**: Handling compaction, context, and continuity
- **Workflow Optimization**: Making the most of AI assistance

## What Belongs Here
- Claude collaboration patterns
- Context management strategies
- Compaction recovery procedures
- Dual-system workflows (temporary vs persistent tasks)
- Output formatting standards
- Error recovery with Claude
- Session handoff procedures

## What Does NOT Belong Here
- Project-specific implementation details
- Pure process that works without AI
- Tool-specific commands (unless about Claude interaction)

## Key Documents
- **DUAL-SYSTEM-STRATEGY.md**: TodoWrite + MCP workflow for task management
- **CRASH-RECOVERY-PROCEDURE.md**: How to recover from Claude session interruptions
- Future additions for Claude-specific workflows

## Usage
These documents help any team working with Claude achieve maximum productivity. The patterns are battle-tested through real project execution and address common friction points in AI-assisted development.
