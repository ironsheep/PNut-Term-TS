and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.6] - 2025-01-10

### Added

- **Headless mode** (`--headless`) for AI agents and CI/CD automation
  - Run without GUI windows, output to log files only
  - `--timeout <seconds>` - Auto-exit after specified duration
  - `--end-marker [phrase]` - Auto-exit when phrase detected in serial output
    - Default recognizes both `END_SESSION` and `DEBUG_END_SESSION` (PNut compatibility)
    - Custom phrases supported: `--end-marker "MY_PHRASE"`
  - Enables Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI agents to do hardware-in-the-loop testing
  - Three termination modes: signal (Ctrl+C), timeout, or end-marker detection

### Fixed

- macOS code signing in GitHub Actions release workflow
  - Proper inside-out signing order for Electron frameworks
  - Added USB/serial device entitlements for hardware access
  - Fixed DMG volume icon and app icon paths
- Suppress PropPlug "not found" warning when showing help or when auto-detect succeeds

## [0.9.5] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- Baud rate status indicator in main window status bar (both IDE and Standard modes)

### Fixed

- Case-insensitive device serial number matching for `-p/--plug` option
- Device selection now accepts serial numbers in any case (e.g., `p6yh4spg`, `P6yh4spg`, `P6YH4SPG`)

## [0.9.4] - 2025-11-19

### Added

- PropPlug device management system with persistent per-device settings
- PropPlug Management tab in Preferences dialog for viewing/editing known devices
- Per-device DTR/RTS control line settings (automatically determined by device type with manual override)
- Project-level PropPlug selection in Preferences
- Automatic discovery and tracking of new PropPlug devices
- Friendly name support for PropPlug devices

### Changed

- Exit with error if `-p` specifies a device that is not found (previously would silently proceed to UI)
- Control line (DTR/RTS) now determined per-device instead of global setting
- Device selection now matches by serial number in addition to path

### Known Issues

- The **Windows arm64 build** is having issues. It is not opening the serial port. This, so far, appears to be an [npm serialport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport) issue. We filed a bug report to get clarification and/or a fix.

- **SPECIAL REQUEST**: If you have a **native arm64 Windows machine** please test this build and let me know if it works. I'm running Windows 11 Pro under Parallels on a macOS (Apple Silicon) machine and this problem may be limited to my context!

## [0.9.3] - 2025-11-17

### Added

- Add `-m, --match-vendor-only` option to match any FTDI device (VID 0x0403), ignoring product ID

## [0.9.2] - 2025-11-14

### Changes

- Improve main window layout when --IDE mode (used by VSCode)
- Use Local time within debug and USB log files, not UTC
- Disable Chromium sandbox to prevent Linux runtime error requiring root permissions
- Fixed macOS signing so that .dmg's can now be notarised

## [0.9.1] - 2025-11-09

- Packaging cleanup

## [0.9.0] - 2025-11-08

### Added
